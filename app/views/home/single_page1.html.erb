  <p class="para_top">Children are our most valuable Natural Resource and Wealth. It's our duty to protect them with great love and care from the hazards of the outside world.</p>
  <p class="para_top">The Internet is absolutely loaded with content and activities that are entertaining and educational for children. Modern kids have access to online and offline resources vastly beyond what their parents can even think and beyond what some grandparents even understand. Parents have enough to worry about the dangers children may face every day on the computer especially on the internet. </p>
  <p class="para_top">The kids can get into trouble in various ways through the use of computer and internet. Some of the significant ways are as follows</p>

  <p class="para_top">Nasty Websites: When home video players first came out, the porn industry roared right in to supply porn videos. Likewise, as soon as the Internet population reached critical mass, porn sites popped up like mushrooms. Young kids may encounter these by accident; hormone-crazed teens may seek them out deliberately. Gambling sites, sites promoting drugs or weapons, school cheating sites - There are a lot of places on the Internet your kids shouldn't go.</p>
  <p class="para_top">Dangerous Contacts: E-mail, instant messaging, and social networking allow your children a rich opportunity to communicate with friends and family even when they're not nearby. It also exposes them to contact from absolutely anyone at all, including people you'd never let near them in person. Pedophiles groom contacts, establishing trust and possibly leading to a disastrous real-world meeting.</p>

  <p class="para_top">Internet Overdose: There are reportedly over a trillion Web pages out there. Your child could stay glued to the monitor day and night and never see them all. Staying up all night playing games leaves kids too tired to think in school, and sitting motionless at the computer for hours won't help their physical development or health, either.</p>
  <p class="para_top">Cyber-Bullying: It is fun for kids to connect with friends and family through social networking and chat, but this ability has a dark side. Kids can be insulted and bullied online, sometimes the point of feeling suicidal. Unlike physical bullying, parents can't see cyber-bullying when it happens.</p>
  <p class="para_top">USB Flash drive / CD ROM / DVD ROM: External data storage devices like CD ROM, DVD ROM, USB Flash drives are very much essential and popular media nowadays. Kids are also very much accustomed to these kinds of media. Various obnoxious or objectionable data or materials can readily be accessed through such form which can easily influence the physical and psychological health of a child.</p>

The teens have become a major portion of the smartphone users. The greatest advantage of using a smartphone is, the users remain connected with others through the internet. But allowing them to be online all the time, increases  the risk of cyberbullyingâ€”harassment using Internet-based communications tools.</p>
